## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.

## Positive Community Examples

Here's what we love to see:

**Asking for Help:**
> "I'm stuck on Part 3, section 2. I'm getting a TypeScript error when trying to query the database. I've tried X and Y. Here's my code. Can someone point me in the right direction?"

**Offering Help:**
> "I had the same issue! The problem is likely that you need to await the database call. Here's the pattern I used. Let me know if that helps!"

**Giving Feedback:**
> "Thanks for this PR! The explanation is really clear. One suggestion: could we add an example showing what happens when this fails? I think it would help beginners understand the error handling better."

**Receiving Feedback:**
> "Great point! I'll add that example. Thanks for the thorough review!"

## Learning Together

Remember: **Everyone in this community is learning.**

- Senior developers are learning new frameworks

We are committed to:

- **Accessibility** - Making learning available to everyone
- **Inclusivity** - Creating a space where all feel welcome
- **Quality** - Maintaining high standards for content
